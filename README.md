# Email-SMS-Spam-Classifier
The task of classification is the most popular spam filtering formulation. 
The goal is to determine whether a text message is spam or not. Past work, 
however, varied in terms of which dataset types are employed for training 
and testing. 
In this project, our aim is to train, test and compare different traditional 
machine learning classifiers and deep learning techniques on different 
datasets. On the basis of their accuracies, precision and recall, various 
considered classifiers are evaluated. A comparison and analysis of all the 
techniques has been then carried out
